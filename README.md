# Lambda Treasure Hunt

Welcome to the first annual Lambda Treasure Hunt!

After the war between the humans and machines, we were left in a world straddling the line between physical and digital. You, the elite chosen of Lambda School, have been selected to participate in an hunt for digital riches. Great glory and rewards await the most efficient treasure hunters. Will you divine the many secrets of the ever-evolving island and prove yourself worthy of our algorithmic overlords?

Happy hunting!


## Overview

You start the adventure unworthy, unequipped and anonymous. Your first task is to traverse the island and build a map for your personal use. Along the way, you will discover equipment, treasure and clues which will assist you on your quest for power, wealth and glory.


## Rooms

The map is laid out in a grid: Similar to your worlds from Week 1 of your CS training, each room may have exits in the cardinal directions: north, south, east and west. Each room also comes with a unique ID and coordinates for your convenience.

```
// Starting room
{
  "room_id": 0,
  "title": "Room 0",
  "description": "You are standing in an empty room.",
  "coordinates": "(60,60)",
  "players": [],
  "items": ["small treasure"],
  "exits": ["n", "s", "e", "w"],
  "cooldown": 60.0,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```


## Cooldown

Your access to the server is restricted until you earn more power. Starting off, you are only allowed to make one request every 60 seconds. Sending another request before that time has elapsed will incur a penalty.


## Movement

All actions are executed via REST API commands to the Lambda Treasure Hunt server. Here is an example movement command:

`
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"direction":"n"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/move/
`

You will receive an authorization token following successful completion of Friday's Sprint Challenge. This serves as your unique identifier and authentication key. Don't share this key!

The URL will determine the command you are sending to the server.

Note the "direction" parameter, which determines which way you will move.


## Building your Map

Your first task is to build your map. Starting from `room 0`, you can begin to construct a graph of the map:

```
{0: {"n": "?", "s": "?", "e": "?", "w": "?"}}
```

Moving North from the starting room will return the following response:

```
{
  "room_id": 10,
  "title": "Room 10",
  "description": "You are standing in an empty room.",
  "coordinates": "(60,61)",
  "players": [],
  "items": [],
  "exits": ["n", "s", "w"],
  "cooldown": 60.0,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": ["You have walked north."]
}
```
This room has an ID of 10 and contains exits to the north, south and west. Now, you can fill out another entry in your graph:

```
{
  0: {"n": 10, "s": "?", "e": "?", "w": "?"},
  10: {"n": "?", "s": 10, "w": "?"}
}
```

There are a total of 500 rooms so be thoughtful about how you traverse the map.

Hint 1: What is the best algorithm to traverse a map without backtracking?

Hint 2: What do you do when you hit a dead end? What is the best algorithm for finding the nearest room with unexplored exits?

## Wise Explorer

An accurate map is the wise explorer's best friend. By predicting the ID of the destination room, you can reduce your action cooldown by 50%. Say you are in `room 10` and moving back south to `room 0`:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"direction":"s", "next_room_id": "0"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/move/
```

Note the new parameter, `next_room_id`. Your map tells you that `room 0` lies south of `room 10`. This returns the following response:

```
{
  "room_id": 0,
  "title": "Room 0",
  "description": "You are standing in an empty room.",
  "coordinates": "(60,60)",
  "players": [],
  "items": ["small treasure"],
  "exits": ["n", "s", "e", "w"],
  "cooldown": 30.0,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": ["You have walked south.", "Wise Explorer: -50% CD"]
}
```

Note the `Wise Explorer` bonus and 50% cooldown reduction.


## Treasure

You may have noticed the small treasure lying in the room. You can pick it up with the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"treasure"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/take/
```

You may drop items with the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"treasure"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/drop/

```

## Selling Treasure

First, you must find the shop. It's not too far from your starting location. Once you do, you can offer your treasure in exchange for gold.

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"treasure"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/sell/
```

This will return:

```
{
  "room_id": "?",
  "title": "Shop",
  "description": "You are standing in a shop. You can sell your treasure here.",
  "coordinates": "?",
  "players": [],
  "items": [],
  "exits": ["e"],
  "cooldown": 2.0,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": ["I'll give you 100 gold for that Small Treasure.", "(include 'confirm':'yes' to sell Small Treasure)"]
}
```

Confirm the sale with the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"treasure", "confirm":"yes"}' https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/sell/
```

## Status, Inventory

You can check your status and inventory using the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token 7a375b52bdc410eebbc878ed3e58b2e94a8cb607' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://lambda-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com/api/adv/status/
```

```
{
  "name": "br80",
  "cooldown": 2.0,
  "encumbrance": 2,  // How much are you carrying?
  "strength": 10,  // How much can you carry?
  "speed": 10,  // How fast do you travel?
  "gold": 400,
  "inventory": ["Small Treasure"],
  "status": [],
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

## Mystery

The island is constantly evolving and full of mysteries. As time passes and you explore the map, you will discover ancient clues and artifacts which will lead to greater power and riches.

Happy hunting!
